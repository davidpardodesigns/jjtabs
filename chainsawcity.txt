Verse 1:
Am
In the Chainsaw City, read the book of Detroit steel
Em
Better state your business in a thousand words or more
Am
In the Chainsaw City, there's a million different stories
Em
In the Chainsaw City twenty-five of them are yours
         Am                           Em
Chainsaw City (Chainsaw City), no bad vibes

Return to Am/Em groove

Verse 2:
In the Chainsaw City, like a tired caballero
You gotta swing like Christmas when you're
   dancing with the hordes
In a Chainsaw City, wear your love around your ankles
In a Chainsaw City, swing your envy like a sword
Chainsaw City (Chainsaw City), no bad vibes

Bridge:
Am                    G      D
   That sweet emotion all contrived
Am              G    D
   Only live to lift your lie
Am                         G             D
   See the world through a young child's eyes
Am                    G        D
   Make your bed on a stack of lies
   C       B        Am         Em
We blow to hell the whole damn place
    C       B           Am               Em
And wipe the grin right off your face

return to Am/Em groove

Verse 3:
Here in Chainsaw City, we're blazing to the mountains
Shadow Tom and Harry, throw a shot glass on the floor
Here in Chainsaw City, we will dine with Don Quixote
Here in Chainsaw City, we will shiver to the core
Chainsaw City (Chainsaw City), no bad vibes

Chorus:
D                           C
   Hear that sound, it's the sound of laughter
D                         C
   Hear that sound, it's a banshee wail
D                         C
   Hear that sound, it's a God who's crying (smiling)
D                           C
   Hear that sound, it's the screams from hell

Jam over Am/Em groove

Verse 4:
In the Chainsaw City, we will relish in the slaughter
We will crush the revolution like they crushed the Nez Perce
In the Chainsaw City, we will ride among the razors
Burning Chainsaw City, we will throw that key away
Chainsaw City (Chainsaw City), no bad vibes

Chorus:
Hear that sound, it's the sound of laughter
Hear that sound, it's a banshee wail
Hear that sound, it's a God who's crying
Hear that sound, it's the screams from hell
Hear that sound, it's the sound of pity
Hear that sound, it's the falling snow
Hear that sound, it's the Chainsaw City
Hear that sound when the whole thing blows

End with Main Riff
