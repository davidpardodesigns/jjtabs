    E (implied)              G

     E        G    E        G
It's raining,   of course
           E         G             E       G
I'm not complaining,   it could be worse

B7                            C7
   I read the paper about the shape the world is in
B7                                 C7
   And my small catastrophes don't beg comparison

       E     G    E       G
You're angry   up there
    E     G   E       G
I'm sorry   I swear
 
B7                            C7
   I've got some photographs, taken in Berlin
B7                         C7
   A testament to just how distant I have been

      G            A                C
Well, baby you can drive out to the coast
    G               A           C
And say a prayer to exorcise my ghost
   G              A               C
Or take a hundred scented baths a day
         G           A             C
But your never gonna wash my love away

    E     G           E      G
The crime   and punishment
    E       G     E      G
The letters   you sent
 
B7                              C7
   These Russian authors always leave be bored cold
B7                                C7
   Your simple phrasing sure does scar me to my soul

      G            A             C
Well, baby you can saddle up and ride
       G              A             C
With a pizza boy like Tonto by your side
   G                 A                  C
Or kick and fuss and curse the years we spent
   G              A               C
Or chalk it up to crime and punishment

(Solo)

     E        G    E        G
It's raining,   of course
           E         G             E       G
I'm not complaining,   it could be worse
 
B7                             C7
   I read the papers about the shit my world is in
B7                               C7
   And my small annoyances don't beg comparisons
 
      G            A             C
Well, baby you can saddle up and ride
    G              A                 C
And make believe I took the hint and died
   G               A                    C
Or swim out past exhaustion through the tide
       G                  A
But if you can't save yourself
      C
   At least you'll save your pride
      G                  A
Yeah, you can't save yourself
   C
   At least you'll save your pride

G             A                C
Baby, you can drive out to the coast
    G               A           C
And say a prayer to exorcise my ghost
   G                 A                  C
Or kick and fuss and curse the years we spent
   G              A               C
Or chalk it up to crime and punishment
      G              A               C
Yeah, chalk it up to crime and punishment
