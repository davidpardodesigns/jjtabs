Verse 1:
F       D    G  F    D      G
You can hear      it comin'
F      D     G     F     D    G  F
Like a train   out of control
D      G      F   D         G
Surely leaves you wonderin'
  F     D     G      F      D    G
Exactly where   your ticket goes
F   D      G    F      D      G
You scream   to the conductor
    F         D    G     F  D     G
But he's been deaf   for 20 years
F        D  G  F      D        G
Hear the other people laughin'
F     D      G         F     D    G  F
As he grinds   through every gear

F                            G
  Go to grab your nerve, you find that it is missin'
F                                 G
  Seems you've lost your faith in everyone you know
F                        G
  And I surely hope that you don't plan on winnin'
             G
Better start payin' more attention
To the ones that throw you clear
You are seconds from the impact,
           D
And you're movin' way too slow


Verse 2:
Time will surely mold you
Into something you don't like
Get you runnin' like a rabbit
Stick your finger in the dike

Look around your room you find the paint is peelin'
Your reflective skin is fallin' off your bones
Well, I must admit I know just how you're feelin'
We must grab each others collar,
We must rise out of the water
And you know as well as I do it's no fun to die alone


Chorus:
         D
Climb to safety
      After all that I've been through,
         D
                 G             A
      You're the only one that matters
Climb to safety
                                     G               A
            You never left me in the dark here on my own
         D
Climb to safety
                                  G                A
            Feel the water rising.  Let me be your ladder
         D
Climb to safety
                                        G        A
            I promise you'll be dry and never be alone

(Main Riff)

Verse 3:
Love has always scared you
Like the things under your bed
Baby, we can walk on water
Like some junkies swore they did

You call me on the phone, you say that it is crucial
You stick your fingers in your ears 'til they explode
I guess the business will be goin' on as usual
We must grab each others collar,
We must rise out of the water
'Cause you know as well as I do
That it's no fun to die alone

(Chorus)
