   A                    D

A                             D
All your plastic bullets, are   finally right on target
    A                      D
And   now may commend your accuracy
A                            D
  Made another great escape,   blew out into space
      A                                 D
And I   think the boat was a little too late for me

A                             D
Where's your virgin daughter,   hide the scotch and water
A                   D
  It's the only medicine for me
A                         D
  I know your a stranger,   but grant one last favor
A                            D
  Cut these rubber bands and   let me bleed

     D                        E
It's hard to notice when your high all the time
              D                     E
You've got to   look up, look out into the sky
              D
'Cause if you can't see the warning signs
E
Heart's gone blind

A  D

A
  It's hard to keep on slipping
D
  When your climbing icy ladders
A                          D
It's a long hard fall to a   cold, cold sea
A
  I made another great escape baby
D
  Blew out into space
      A                               D
And I think the boat was a little too late for me

     D                        E
It's hard to notice when your high all the time
              D                     E
You've got to   look up, look out into the sky
              D
'Cause if you can't see the warning signs
E
Heart's gone blind
D            A
Heart's gone blind
D            A
Heart's gone blind (Take a look at yourself sometimes)
D            A
Heart's gone blind (Take a look at myself sometimes)
D            A
Heart's gone blind

A                            D
Say that it does not matter,   leave my soul in tatters
A                           D
More and more show a little   apathy
A
  You say that it does not matter
D
  Leave my heart all scattered
A                             D
  Swamped in terrorists acts,   futility

     D                        E
It's hard to notice when your high all the time
              D                     E
You've got to   look up, look out into the sky
              D
'Cause if you can't see the warning signs
E
Heart's gone blind
D            A
Heart's gone blind
D            A
Heart's gone blind
D            A
Heart's gone blind (Take a look at yourself sometimes)
D            A
Heart's gone blind (Take a look at myself sometimes)
D            A
Heart's gone blind (And we don't always like what we find)
D            A
Heart's gone blind (Because baby, sometimes our hearts go blind)

A                   D        A              D
  Long coats on the prairie,   lying in the dust
A           D
  Who can I turn to?
A           D
  Who can I trust?
A                  D
  We're walking on water
A                        D
  And we're lying in the sun
A                             D
  While the world is spinning faster
A                        D
  Then it did when I was young
A                           D
  And the world is spinning faster
A                        D
  Then it did when I was young
