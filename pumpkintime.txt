    C       G
The charmed life
C           G
Best I ever seen
    C    G
The good life
C     C            G
Every place you've been
      C   G
I can see you
    C               G
The princess at the ball
               C     G
Hey, play your cards right
    C               G
You could've won it all

F               C
See you haven't noticed
    F                C
The clock is turning twelve
F           C       
Better pay attention
       F              C
To the ringing of the bell

   C G  
An angel
   C             G
To cover up your past
  C   G
A kingdom
      C               G
For a slipper made of glass, right on

F                C
Back seat of the limousine
F              C
Vouch for your valet
F        C
Optical illusions
        F              C
All you do and all you say

      D       C
Yeah, pumpkin time
      D       C
Yeah, pumpkin time
      D          C
Better keep your head, alright baby

C > G

C    G
Farm life
C             G
Left it all behind
  C   G
Returning
C                   G
Not what you had in mind

F             C
Debutants and dowries
F                  C
Might as well pull tricks
F             C         
Etiquette and bad breath
     F              C
Will get you eighty-sixed
F                 C       
Velvet, silk, and cashmere
      F             C
Won't cover up your tracks
F                  C
All the things you could've done,
F                   C
Years you can't get back

      D       C
Yeah, pumpkin time
      D       C
Yeah, pumpkin time
      D          C
Better keep your head, alright baby

C > G

C   G
Pay phone
        C                   G
See you scrounge around for change
         C   G
Got some big plans
        C             G
I guess plans get rearranged
F               C
See you in your party dress
F            C
Lying in the dirt
F                    C
Next time you should buy a watch
  F                 C
I think it wouldn't hurt

D       C   
Pumpkin time
      D       C
Yeah, pumpkin time
       D         C
Better keep your head

C > G

     D       C   
Hey, pumpkin time
     D       C
Hey, pumpkin time
       D         C
Better keep your head
             C       G
In a pumpkin time
C   G
        In a pumpkin
C   G                G
        In a pumpkin time
