      G
Well, from a captain's cabin
Our Lady Lebanon
D
Called up old St. Mary
Said get the counselor on the phone
                C
You see there's been a change of strategy
Everything's gone wrong
              G
We're pulling anchors in the morning
We must be moving on
              G
And then they sailed off in the sunset
Some against their will
              D
They sailed into the month of April
They landed in Brazil
                 C
She said, "We'll stay here with the circus
We've a little time to kill
G
Welcome to the New World
This is not a drill"

        G
So they camped under the big top
With the elephants and snakes
        D
Bearded lady and the lizard boy
Were tired of the wait
           C
They could sense the battle looming
See the demons at the gate
               G
They said, "If Christ is really coming
Let's pray he isn't late"
     G
Then Gabriel and Marona
Showed up with horns in hands
D
Jesus couldn't make it
We're sure you'll understand
       C
And he wanted you to know
He appreciates your helping hand
        G
In this world of good and evil
Time for you to make a stand

           G
It was the war at the end of the world
           Em
It was the war at the end of the world
     C
They probably were not ready
Had the flags unfurled
    D                     G
The war at the end if the world

     G
They loaded up the cannons
Polished up the swords
        D
And the band played Jackie Wilson
As they marched against the hoards
            C
The bearded lady said I may die young
At least I won't be bored
       G
Let us triumph over evil
In service of the Lord
              G
And then they fought with smiles and bravery
Devil had them in retreat
    D
St. Mann swung his battle-axe
Bodies piled up his feet
           C
They could smell the sky was burning
Blood ran waist deep in the street
  G
I hate to tell you lady
This ain't no way to beat the heat

           D
It was the war at the end of the world
           Em
It was the war at the end of the world
     C     
They fought it for the children
Little boys and girls
           D                     G     
It was the war at the end of the world

         Em
Then the dwarf said to the counselor
Our ammos all been used
        D#
And you better tell our lady
I think we're gonna lose
            D
They're not taking any prisoners
They'll kill us all before they're through
       C
I must admit the thought of hell
Is giving me the blues
        Em
And St. Mary chimed in
I think I must concur
         D#
That the battle's going badly
And it's getting worse
    D
And all our holy water
Will never drown this curse
        C
And I'd rather leave here running
Than leave here in a hearse

             G
And then the counselor said to me
I hate to break it you son
              D
But I've been watching you for hours
And you're lousy with a gun
      C
If it is your intention
To see the rising sun
    G
St. Mary's on the money
I think you better run
       G
And as I turned tail
Our lady said, "I ain't afraid to die
    D
The island's really sinking
Take it to the skies
       C
And if I go down in gunfire
Can't say I didn't try."
    G
She jumped into the pyre
Tears of victory in her eyes

           G
It was the war at the end of the world
           Em
It was the war at the end of the world
        C
I could not believe my eyes
Or anything I heard
       D                     G
In the war at the end of the world

    G
The last time I inquired
War still raging on
D
Elephants and clowns are dead
And I see the trees are gone
           C
As for our lady and the counselor
I believe they had a son
             G
And if he fulfills the prophecy
The battle will be won
         G
And then on that day of glory
They will line up on the curbs
           D
And then a circus will parade
With the faithful that have served
    C
And Christ winks at our Lady
Says you got a lot of nerve
         G
Now let's put them all to bed
Get the rest that we deserve

           G
It was the war at the end of the world
           Em
It was the war at the end of the world
        C
All the destitute and dying
They rallied 'round His word
        D                     G
And the war at the end of the world

           G
It was the war at the end of the world
           Em
It was the war at the end of the world
                C
If you're gonna die for somebody

Well, it might as well be the Lord
       D                     F
In the war at the end of the world
