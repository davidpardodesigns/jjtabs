D
She said beware the transformation
Any love can turn on cue
I forgo the information
What's an angry man to do?
Drench my words in milk and honey
Join your lonely hearts club band
Swear it's not about the money
As long as your still clapping hands
And...

G            E               D
   I'm gonna trust my little tiger
G            E            D
   My little tiger always knows what's good for me, yeah

D
Take me back to Mississippi
Wrap my love in opaque calm (old pecan?)
I don't need to know your history,
Tuscaloosa tumble on
Drag my ass back thru the fire
I don't care who's right or wrong
Task at hand is who gets higher
I don't care what drugs your on

G            E               D
   I'm gonna trust my little tiger
G            E            D
   My little tiger always knows what's true for me
G            E               D
   I'm gonna trust my little tiger
G            E            D
   My little tiger always gives it up for me

       A               G
We all need someone to hold our faith
       A               G
We all need someone to stroke our face
       A               G
We all need someone to kiss our lips
    C                  E
And tell us that we'll get through this, yeah

G            E               D
   I'm gonna trust my little tiger
G            E            D
   My little tiger always lays it out for me
G            E               D
   I'm gonna trust my little tiger
G            E            D
   My little tiger always gives it up guilt free

D
Boys on boys and peanut butter
Girls on girls and trucker speed
Strangers who compose as lovers
This is what my tiger needs
Bring the bastards to attention
I got more than what I want
Lovers here too scarred to mention
I need more than what I got, baby

G            E               D
   I'm gonna trust my little tiger
G            E            D
   My little tiger always knows what's cool for me
G            E               D
   I'm gonna trust my little tiger
G            E            D
   My little tiger always dials it in for me

       A               G
We all need someone to give us space
   A                G
To hold our hearts, save our place
       A               G
We all need someone to shake our hips
    C                  E
And tell us that we're good at this

       A                G
We all need someone to hold our faith
       A               G
We all need someone to stroke our face
       A               G
We all need someone to kiss our lips
    C                  E
And tell us that we'll get through this, yeah

G            E               D
   I'm gonna trust my little tiger
G            E            D
   My little tiger always knows what's good for me
G            E               D
   I'm gonna trust my little tiger
G            E            D
   My little tiger always tells the truth to me
