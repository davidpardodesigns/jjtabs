                         G

B
Savoring the moments you finally get alone,
A
Locked up in the bathroom shaving legs down to the bone.
     E                  B
Your artistry leaves me breathless.
B
Fifty silver staples running up and down each arm.
    A
Whatever keeps you focused, keeps you out of harm
  E                   B
I understand, you get restless

G                              A
   Mornings like these hey, we all get bored
G                         A
   You keep on telling me that's what friends are for

B
Moving like a reptile, war paint on your chest.
A
Things that get you off stink and make a mess.
E
   But you really ought to see your bright eyes.
          B
When they sparkle just like diamonds and pearls

B (with Main Riff)
Hey, you're on my machine again
    G
You holler at me again
                        B
You say I'm missing the fun
B (with Main Riff)
Hey, they turned off the fridge again
              G
Bandaged your wrists again
With a stapling....
F#            G
When I think about you
        D               A
I think skin as soft as butter
       F#                 G
Like a warrior child from Africa
       D               A
You're fending off the others
        D                 A
And you love it when they run
                 G
From your staple gun

Jam over B    A    E

B
Swabbing out the fluids, mixing up the muds.
     A
It's hard to keep a hard-on covered with your blood.
     E                                         B
It's time to get committed and the cameras are rolling

G                           A
Mornings like these hey, we all get bored.
G                      A
You keep on telling me that's what love is for.

B (with Main Riff)
Hey, you're on my machine again
    G
You holler at me again
                        B
You say I'm missing the fun
B (with Main Riff)
Hey, they turned off the fridge again
              G
Bandaged your wrists again
With a stapling....
F#            G
When I think about you
        D               A
I think skin as soft as butter
       F#                 G
Like a warrior child from Africa
       D               A
You're fending off the others
F#            G
When I think about you
        D               A
I think skin as soft as butter
       F#                 G
Like a warrior child from Africa
       D               A
You're fending off the others
F#            G
When I think about you
        D               A
I think skin as soft as butter
       F#                 G
Like a warrior child from Africa
       D               A
You're fending off the others
        D                 A
And you love it when they run
                 G
From your staple gun
