      C
Well, here in Electric City
          F               C
Built the Calvin Coolidge dam
     C
With American Standard concrete
      G
And a Russian, Cuban, Jewish man

     C
With day-glow paint on money
          F               C
We've had visions once or twice
       C
As our flags wave on the boulevard
    G                C
Our morals carved in ice

      C
We're playing pineful anthems
       F          C
Of the mighty echoplex
     C
In a Mormon tribal fashion
        G
For our popes and heretics

   C
We rub our flesh with tenderloin
    F                   C
And wash our souls with sesame
     C
We'd like to buy the world a Coke
    G               C
And sing in perfect harmony

F  
     G   C                   F
American standard
                   We aim to please

     G        C                           F
American      standard
         Love everyone, and everything we see

     G   C                  F
American standard
                  We aim to please
     G   Am
American standard


We brand the cattle and the children
Conviction's firm when we know what's ours
Apples, onions, mustard, relish
Basketball, and foreign cars

Hip, hip, hooray for Louis Armstrong, 
Miles Davis, and John Wayne
Three gracious cheers for God almighty
And all aboard the gravy train

American standard
                  We aim to please
American      standard
         Love everyone, and everything we see
American standard
                  We aim to please
American standard

Hip, hip, hooray for Louis Armstrong,
Freddie Mercury, and John Wayne,
Three gracious cheers for God almighty
And all aboard the gravy train

We got no secrets, got no fears
You call our names, you've got our ears
We say our prayers for third world babies
Baskin' in these our gold years

American standard
                  We aim to please
American      standard
         Love everyone, and everything we see
American standard
                  We aim to please
American      standard
         Love everyone, and everybody now
American standard
                  Love everybody now
American standard
                  I see you wave your sunny day
American standard
                  I see you wave your sunny day
American standard
                  Like a princess on parade
American standard
                  Like a junkie in the shade
American standard
                  Like the promises we made
American standard
                  Like more fodder for our braves
American standard
                  And the morals we have saved
American standard
                  Like a princess on parade
American standard
                  I see you wave your sunny day
American standard
                  Up and down Magnolia Boulevard
American standard
                  And up and down 8th avenue
American standard
                  And up and down Lahoya Boulevard
American standard
                  And up and down Columbus Avenue
American standard
                  And up and down Pekoe Boulevard
American standard
         Avenue A, and Avenue D, and Avenue C, baby
American standard
                  I see you wave your sunny day
American standard
                  You're a princess on parade
American standard
                  Drinkin' gin and lemonade
American standard
                  You're a princess on parade
American standard
                  We aim to please
American standard
                  We aim to please
American      standard
         Love everyone and everything we see
American standard
