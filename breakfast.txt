          E        B
Well, her dog just died
    A              E
And I'm behind the wheel
        E         B
She was so tongue-tied
         A               E
When she blew that final deal
          A      E
Now she's so, so tired
A                 E
Sleep will do her well
     B             A              E
Everybody's having breakfast at Lucille's

        E                    B
And her friends, friends all say
          A            E
You gotta sing a happy song
    E                           B
But baby, on this judge, on the judgment days
          A                E
Well, I'm feeling just all wrong
     A           E
Just so sick and tired
A                    E
Death will serve her well
     B             A              E
Everybody's having breakfast at Lucille's

         B                   A
A jug of wine, a baby's last meal
             B                   A
You got your contract signed and sealed
             B                    C#m               A
And now your cross, your nail for real, they're for real
     B             A              E
Everybody's having breakfast at Lucille's

E
   One of these days
B
   Hear the voice that call
                A
Where you gonna run to?
      E
Move along
E
   One of these days
B
   Hear the voice that call
                A
Where you gonna run to?
      E
Move along
    A                                          E
You gonna run to the rock and rest yourself so far
A                                   E
   To the rock and rest yourself so far
B                    A
   One of these days   the voice is gonna call me
                 E
Where am I gonna run?

        E                     B
Tell me Papa, tell me why the hell
        A                  E
Why the Bible's lined with hope?
            E                         B
Because the souls, yeah the souls you save
         A                     E
They are slaves you've already sold
        A                  E
And she choked on the last meal
        A             E
Crowded gates, silent stare
     B             A              E
Everybody's having breakfast at Lucille's

         B                   A
A jug of wine, a baby's last meal
             B                   A
You got your contract signed and sealed
             B                    C#m               A
And now your cross, your nail for real, they're for real
     B             A              E
Everybody's having breakfast at Lucille's

The chicks are, Chippewa, Your grandma
            B           A              E
Forget everybody having breakfast at Lucille's
(a capella)
Let 'em in, let 'em out
Everybody that I care about
     B             A              E
Everybody's having breakfast at Lucille's
